            <p>It all started in 2022, when a group of friends in the UAE decided to pick up trash in a beach that we live nearby. That then eventually escalated into this massive organization that spans all over the world with many volunteers and staff helping to Save Our Seas!</p>

        <h2>2022</h2>
        <div>
            <p>We started in September of 2022 as just 3 guys who had a little bit of free time and we decided to a nearby beach and clean it. Locals saw what we were doing and decided to help out as well. That's when we noticed that this could be a big thing. If we just became the people that would motivate others around the world to clean up the beaches, we could make a huge impact in the world! So we founded Save the Seas! a non-profit organization whose goal is to pick up as much trash and debris from the ocean as we can.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">After over a month of cleaning, with the help of some generous locals and people who donated, we have fully cleaned the local beach for everyone to enjoy. This was the first big milestone we hav in our journey. From then on, we started traveling all over the country to clean the beaches for the people our nation to enjoy.</p>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px;">Egypt! The country where one of the first civilizations existed, also became the first foreign country that this organization helped! We started cleaning on the part of the Nile River near the city of Alexandria. With the help of volunteers, we were able to clean that part for the locals to enjoy. To this day, we are still traveling all over Egypt to clean their beaches and waters.</p>

                <p>Who would have thought? The leader of one of the most powerful countries in history has endorsed our organization! With this tweet, the floodgates of donations had opened and as of April 2023, we have reached almost 20 million USD in donations. Thanks to this generous offering, we expanded to even more countries and bought more equipment from scuba gear to boats. P.S. the ice cream chat with President Biden was very enjoyable. We talked about ice cream and the geopolitical state of Taiwan.</p>
